### How to play
1. Touch anywhere to start the game. It will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.
2. It will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.
3. If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly. It responds with a "Deeedooo" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
